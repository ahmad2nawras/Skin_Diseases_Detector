Keratoacanthoma is a dome-shaped lump or tumor that grows on your skin. Once you spot it, it's important to talk to your doctor. It sometimes happens to people before they get squamous cell carcinoma, the second most common type of skin cancer. If you catch the problem early, treatment usually works well.
